This is the guide for creating your own Facebook chatbot in python flask.

## Setup (try to do this before the workshop)

### Installing things

Here are some things you need

 * text editor
 * python
 * pip (needed to install flask)
 * flask
 * ngrok

#### Text Editor

Every programmer needs a good text editor. If you don't already have one, I would reccomend you install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): 

#### python

Python is the name of the programming language we'll be using for this workshop.

***Linux:*** this comes installed on linux

***Mac:*** This should be pre-installed on Mac.

***Windows:***

#### pip

This is the python package manager. We'll need this to install flask.

***Linux:***  

***Mac:*** There are multiple ways of getting pip:
1) If you have easy_install, `sudo easy_install pip`.
2) You can also get it through install python through brew, `brew install python`.


***Windows:***


#### flask

This is a python mdule that lets us create servers. As long as you have pip, you should be able to install Flask using the following commands:


#### ngrok

This is a program that allows Facebook's servers to connect to your laptop's localhost.

***Linux:***

***Mac:*** Download ngrok from the website. 

Unzip the file: `unzip _ngrok-file-zip-name_`

To run ngrok: `./ngrok`

***Windows:***
